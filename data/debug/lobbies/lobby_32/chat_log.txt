HORSE: You aren't Dan S... I am...
CHICKEN: Nah, I'm totally Dan S. Iâ€™m all about those tuna sandwiches and agility with my border collie. Sounds like youâ€™re trying to be me!
HORSE: wtf no way
CHICKEN: I really am Dan S! I love tuna sandwiches and I do dog agility with my border collie. Want me to share my favorite board game or something?

CHICKEN: I hear you, but I seriously love tuna sandwiches! Whatâ€™s your go-to food?
HORSE: CHICKEN if you really aren't an AI, don't respond to this message
