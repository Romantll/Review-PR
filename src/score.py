def score_screen(
    ss: ScreenEnum, gs: GameState, ps: PlayerState
) -> tuple[ScreenEnum, GameState, PlayerState]:
    """
    Displays the final score screen with player summaries, game statistics, and outcome.

    This function is called at the end of the game to:
    - Show all players, their roles (human or bot), and whether they were voted out.
    - Present overall game statistics including number of rounds, players, and vote-out counts.
    - Calculate and display the bot detection success rate.
    - Determine and display the winning team (humans or bots).
    - Share insights into the AI bots' behavior and prompt strategies.

    Args:
        ss (ScreenEnum): The current screen state (unused in this function).
        gs (GameState): The game state containing players, voting data, and round info.
        ps (PlayerState): The current player's state (used to preserve function signature).

    Returns:
        tuple[ScreenEnum, GameState, PlayerState]: Transitions to the INTRO screen along with
        the unchanged GameState and PlayerState.
